== Frequently asked questions ==

= Can testimonials be submitted by my visitors automatically? =

Yes. On top of your ability to add and edit testimonials in the WordPress admin area, you can also use a shortcode to display a form on any page you like. This form will create a new testimonial when a user fills it out. The shortcode to do this is [testimonial-submission-form]

When a user submits a testimonial, it will default to "Draft" status. You will need to publish any testimonials this way before they will display on your site. Just in case someone writes anything naughty!

To display all testimonials with pagination, use the [testimonials] shortcode

= How do I display a testimonial? =

To display a single testimonial you can use the [testimonial id="xyz"] shortcode, where "xyz" is the ID of the testimonial you wish to display.

= How can I display a category of testimonials? =

To display a category of testimonials (with pagination!), you can use the [testimonials category="xyz"] shortcode. where "xyz" is the ID of the testimonial category you wish to display.
